# Webscrappers

These are the two original webscrappers that I created that got me my first job.  

The forbes scraper just takes a list of the top masters degrees and there statistics and saves it to an excel file

The ncbi scrapper takes the values from the interactive bar chart of RPKM values per tissue that can be found for most genes.  This scrapper takes time to run and is best run in batches that can be specified in the beginning of the code.
